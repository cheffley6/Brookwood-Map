State of the Page Address 3/19/17
-website hasn't been touched in a month, been busy with school and stuff but am going to start adding/finishing pages, adding a contact/credit page, possibly implement other ideas (search function? schedules, lists) and prepping for an official release
-priority one: finishing all data for each classroom, THEN implementing new features
-clean up the image used for the map, possibly add colors for each hall(?)
-add final exam bell schedules, possibly separate page
-search function (look up a teacher or classroom and immediately get page for that, possibly have to compile a couple giant arrays for all classes/teachers (probably too complicated tbh))
-add a/b times on bell schedule
-have some degree of css anywhere on the page
-page include picture of classroom? probably not
-could link to teacher's webpage on their room site if they have a public one like dimsdale
